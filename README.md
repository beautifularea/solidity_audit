# The Solidity Contract-Oriented Programming Language

Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts
that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart contracts are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer
network where nobody has special authority over the execution and thus they allow to implement tokens of value,
ownership, voting and other kinds of logics.
